Subcommands:
    version    Display the current version of this tool.
    help       Display the help - how to use this tool.


Options:
    -task      Specify the command with its arguments to run in quoted format.
    -timeout   Specify the number of seconds to allow the task to be running.
    -files     Specify all filenames to stream the output of the execution.
    -save      If present then execution output must also be saved in daily file.
    -console   If present then execution output will also be displayed on terminal.
    -tasksFile Load commands from the provided file (see "example.file" content).
    -tasksJson Load commands from the provided json file (see "example.json" content).
    -tasksToml Load commands from the provided toml file (see "example.toml" content).
    -tasksYaml Load commands from the provided yaml file (see "example.yaml" content).
    

Arguments:
    quoted-command-to-execute      complete command to execute from the shell.
    execution-deadline-in-seconds  number of seconds to have the task running.
    filenames-to-stream-output     space separed filenames where to stream output.

You have to provide at least one mandatory argument value [-task]. The list of files
where to have the output duplicated (in real-time) must be in one word and space
separed. To have the output be saved into a daily file named outputs-<year><month><day>,
just add -save flag when launching the program. Upcoming version will add capabilities
to mention multiple tasks and each task with its own destinations output filenames.
